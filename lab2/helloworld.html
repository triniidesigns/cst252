		<h1>Hello World</h1>
		<p>My name is Juan Trinidad and my major is Communication Design with a concentration in Visual Design. During my free time, I enjoy playing video games and investing. I hope to learn a lot more about HTML and CSS. As for my partner, his name is Miguele Bedolla and I have had class with him before.</p>
