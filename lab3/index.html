	<h1>Lab 3: File Structure & File Transfer</h1>
	<p>The idea of this was to recall the way file structures work by creating multiple labs connecting to one main folder.</p>

	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>The most difficult part about this assignment was trying to recall all the codes needed so they work properly.</p>

	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>Overall, the lab helped me rejog some lost memories while also being challenged.</p>
