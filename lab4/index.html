		<center><h1>Lab 4: Pseudocoding and Problem Solving</h1></center>
		<h2>Idea of the lab</h2>
		<p>The idea of this lab was to get an idea of what Pseudocoding was how to use it for coding.</p>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>The most difficult part of Pseudocoding is trying to think of precise ideas to be consider as psudo.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Overall, the lab was a good practice into getting more comfortable into Pseudocoding for more complex coding as it is a good way to brainstorm ideas before actually writing it.</p>

		<h2>Pseudocoding 1</h2>
		<p>How to use a fire extinguisher:<br>
			Grab… Grab a fire extinguisher.<br>
			PULL... Pull the pin. This will also break the tamper seal.<br>
			AIM... Aim low, pointing the extinguisher nozzle (or its horn or hose) at the base of the fire.<br>
			NOTE: Do not touch the plastic discharge horn on CO2 extinguishers, it gets very cold and may damage skin.<br>
			SQUEEZE... Squeeze the handle to release the extinguishing agent.<br>
			SWEEP... Sweep from side to side at the base of the fire until it appears to be out. Watch the area. If the fire re-ignites, repeat steps 2 - 4.<br></p>

		<p>Pseudo-code for interactive fire extinguisher model<br>
			// 1.Create large display block for simulation<br>
			// 2.Enter “click to start” so it can start<br>
			// 3.First show fire and make fire extinguisher clickable<br>
			// 4.Zoom on extinguisher, and step by step on what to do by clicking the directions<br>
			// 5.Make the user wave mouse back and forth to put out virtual fire.<br>
			// 6.End by putting “congratulations”<br>
			// 7.Test for errors<br>
			// 8.Publish<br></p>

		<h2>Pseudocoding 2</h2>
		<p>Creating a interactive rock, paper, scissors game<br>
			Enter “click to start” so it can start<br>
			Show how much time player has<br>
			Click an option rock, paper, scissors<br>
			Wait for timer to hit 0<br>
			AI will have answer<br>
			AI shows answer.<br>
			Winner is decided.<br></p>

		<p>Pseudo-code for creating a rock, paper, scissors game:<br>
		   	// 1.Create a start button, if user pushes start then game will begin.<br>
		   	// 2.Set a adjusted time to allow users input.<br>
		   	// 3.Provide three options for user to pick.<br>
		   	// 4.Validate input.<br>
		   	// 5.Once timer hits 0, play AI's answer.<br>
		   	// 6.AI's answer is generated randonmly based on the three available options.<br>
		   	// 7.Based on the users and AI's answer, the game will decide the winner.<br></p>
