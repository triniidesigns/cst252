		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>The challenge that I delt with was trying to understand each section of code in the JS file based on the practice in class.</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>The problems that I ran into was displaying the new elements as for some reason class did not display the changes until I changed it to Id.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Overall, the lab was a good practice as it stengthened my understanding.</p>
